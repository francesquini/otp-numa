The Visual tool represents an erlang program as a graph, where the vertices
are erlang actors and the edges are communications between the actors
(normal lines) and parent/child relationships between the actors (dashed
lines).

The size of a vertex corresponds to the actor's lifespan (the bigger is
a vertex - the longer is the lifespan). The width of the normal-line
edges corresponds to the amount of messages exchanged between the actors
(the wider is an edge - the bigger is the amount of the messages).

To work with Visual tools, the user has to:

1) generate a trace file using erl_prof script:
$ sudo ./erl_prof trace_file_name program_name main_function_name

for example, to generate a trace for "ehb" program (stored in bench_explained):
$sudo ./erl_prof ehb_trace ehb run

The trace file is stored in traces/ folder

2) visualize a trace file:
$ python parse.py trace_file_name

A Ubigraph window with the result graph should open.
